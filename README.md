# color-palette-web
A Python based color picker website made using NumPy, Flask, Bootstrap and Pillow. Includes functionality which only allows uploading .png .jpg and .jpeg image files for safety and compatibility reasons. That way we can ensure that users are not able to upload HTML files that would cause XSS problems etc. Also uses secure_filename for safety.
